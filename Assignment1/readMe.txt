A delivery company has two vehicles to serve an area covered by a grid of roads stretching from north to south and from 
east to west every kilometer. At the beginning of the day both vehicles start from position (0, 0). When a vehicle receives 
a set of coordinates for delivery, it moves along the X and Y axis until it reaches the correct position and stays there 
awaiting a new set of coordinates for new delivery. 

The company has a dispatcher that chooses the closest between the two vehicles for the next delivery. 
Upon receiving a new delivery destination the dispatcher prompts both vehicles for their respective distances from the 
required destination and assigns the delivery to the vehicle with the shortest distance.
