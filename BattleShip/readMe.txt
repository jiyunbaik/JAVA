Create a Battleship game with 5 ships on a 5X5 grid field. All ships are single-deckers, i.e. occupy a single square.
The computer places the ships on a field randomly, ships have to be spaced at least one square from each other including diagonally.
The player can shoot 15 times - each time the player shoots, the application checks whether a target has been destroyed, whether the game has ended (all targets are destroyed), updates the map and number of tries left for the player.
Each shot is entered as a set of coordinates - row followed by column.
After every shot, the map has to be redrawn indicating all the hits and misses of the player. 
The hits are to be displayed as X-s and the misses as 0-s. 

Once the player fires 15 times the result is presented together with a map revealing all the remaining ships.
