Create a program that functions as an address book. 
It should have entries containing the following information: first and last name, phone number and email address. 
The entries should be sorted by last name. 
Every new contact will be inserted in such a way as to maintain the alphabetical order. 
Upon each change a display of all the entries is required.
The address book contains a fixed limit on the total number of entries (such as 20). 
However, it should be possible to increase this limit by simply changing a single line in your program and then recompiling with no other modifications.
Create a class Contact and use its objects to hold all the information for each entry in the address book. 
Bonus feature (additional 20% of the mark): An excellent program will be able to display only entries matching a certain criteria (only contacts with last names beginning with the letter 'D', for example).
Do not use array lists.
